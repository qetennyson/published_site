            <h3>Intro</h3>   
                <p>Hello!  I'm Quincy Tennyson, and I'm a Computer Science teacher at Fern Creek High School.<br>
                    <br>My background is in systems and network administration, which the Marine Corps taught me, but I sort of learned how to code at the University of Louisville.<br>
                    <br>Presently, helping new computer science students learn how to solve problems is among my favorite things to do.   I enjoy writing creative and interesting Python code that helps young people internalize computer science and programming concepts.<br>
                    <br>I have numerous interests, but I most certainly have a debilitating addiction to both playing guitar and other people's approval - truly a match made in heaven.<br>
